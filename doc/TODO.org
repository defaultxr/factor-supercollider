#+DESCRIPTION: To-do list for the SuperCollider vocab for Factor.

* Functionality to load and control synths, buffers, buses, groups, etc conveniently from Factor.
** multi-channel expansion
*** semi-relevant: https://re.factorcode.org/2024/02/divmods.html
*** maybe it's possible to auto-generate multiple synthdefs per definition, such that multi-channel expansion is supported?
* Words for all of SuperCollider's [[file:commands.md][OSC commands]].
* Ensure all words have consistent names (~sc-server-buffer-free~ vs ~sc-server-free-buffer~, ~control~ vs ~param~, etc)
* ~UGEN:~ word to define ugens.
* Functionality to auto-generate ugen definitions by scraping from the local SuperCollider instance.
* ~PSEUGEN:~ word to define "pseudo-ugens".
...Or maybe ~SYNTH:~ should automatically do this itself?
* ~SYNTH:~ word to define synthdefs in Factor.
* Functionality to easily convert pseugens to synthdefs and vice-versa.
* ~NODE:~ to define named nodes on the server.
* Metadata about synthdef/ugen parameters, such as their expected input range and standard output range.
* Envelopes.
* Buffer management.
* Task scheduler and tempo clock.
* Handle command replies better.
* Check command replies match the expected message.
* Scrape information from command replies before passing them to the mailbox.
* Implement OSC responders/routing.
* SuperCollider/[cl-patterns](https://github.com/defaultxr/cl-patterns)-esque patterns system (as a separate vocabulary).
* Documentation.
* Tests.
